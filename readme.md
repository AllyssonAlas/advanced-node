## [**Link to the couse**](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-avancado/?referralCode=AF51096F87A7A9A81C5C)

This API is part of Rodrigo Manguinho's (Mango) training at Udemy.

The objective of this training is to show how to create an API with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD (test-oriented programming) as a work methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the SOLID principles and, whenever possible, applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.
